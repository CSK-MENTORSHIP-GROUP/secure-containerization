## Event Summary
**"Secure Containerization: CI/CD Deployment and Management with Azure Container Apps"**
A beginner-friendly, hands-on practical session focused on **building**, **containerizing**, and **deploying** applications using Docker, Azure DevOps, and Azure Container Apps while integrating security best practices into the CI/CD pipeline.

## 🎯 Why is This Important in Today's Tech Industry?
In today's fast-paced digital world, businesses need to deliver applications faster, more reliably, and securely — without compromising on quality. However, with increased speed comes higher security risks, especially in cloud environments.

Modern applications often consist of multiple services (microservices) running across different environments — making it harder to maintain consistency, security, and scalability.

> **This is where containerization + CI/CD + cloud security come in.**
### Why This Matters to Every Developer & Organization 🚨
Without security in the software development process, businesses risk:
- ❌ Data breaches
- ❌ Loss of customer trust
- ❌ Huge fines due to non-compliance (like GDPR or HIPAA)
- ❌ Application downtime during attacks
- ❌ Delayed product releases
